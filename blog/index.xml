Before you begin, remember to import your data.
Viewing your data If your data frame is called df, then use the &amp;lt;str()&amp;gt; function to view it&amp;rsquo;s structure.
str(df)  To view the first six lines of df use the function &amp;lt;head()&amp;gt;.</description>

      <description>Developmental Disabilities Research Day In May of 2018, I was given the opportunity to give an oral presentation for Developmental Disabilities Research Day at Western University.
This was the first oral presentation I had ever done and it was right at the start of my MSc! When I first heard that I was selected for an oral presentation for this event, I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel prepared at all. However, a lab mate at the time gave me the confidence I needed (and helped me practice of course)!</description>

      <title>Migrate from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>
