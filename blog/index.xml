      <description>In this tutorial, I will teach you how to import your data into R from a multitude of sources. Importing your data correctly can help you prevent several time consuming mistakes in the future. Before you begin, remember to put your file into your working directory.
For importation, you will need to install the following packages, respectively.
install.packages(&amp;quot;tidyverse&amp;quot;) install.packages(&amp;quot;readxl&amp;quot;) install.packages(&amp;quot;foreign&amp;quot;)  After you&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded the necessary package, you&amp;rsquo;re ready to import your data!</description>

      <description>In this tutorial, I will teach you how to manage your data in R. Specifically, how to view and select your data, and how to deal with missing data.
Before you begin, remember to import your data.
Viewing your data If your data frame is called df, then use the &amp;lt;str()&amp;gt; function to view it&amp;rsquo;s structure.
str(df)  To view the first six lines of df use the function &amp;lt;head()&amp;gt;.</description>

      <description>As researchers itâ€™s always tough to gage how many participants we need to recruit for our study. There are a number of ways to figure this out, but R offers some good packages that do this for us.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the pwr package. To begin, let&amp;rsquo;s install and call on this package:
install.packages(&amp;quot;pwr&amp;quot;) library(pwr)  Once you&amp;rsquo;ve got that, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the many statistical analyses this package supports.</description>

      <description>Developmental Disabilities Research Day In May of 2018, I was given the opportunity to give an oral presentation for Developmental Disabilities Research Day at Western University.
This was the first oral presentation I had ever done and it was right at the start of my MSc! When I first heard that I was selected for an oral presentation for this event, I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel prepared at all. However, a lab mate at the time gave me the confidence I needed (and helped me practice of course)!</description>
