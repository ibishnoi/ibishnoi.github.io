      <description>Developmental Disabilities Research Day In May of 2018, I was given the opportunity to give an oral presentation for Developmental Disabilities Research Day at Western University.
This was the first oral presentation I had ever done and it was right at the start of my MSc! When I first heard that I was selected for an oral presentation for this event, I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel prepared at all. However, a lab mate at the time gave me the confidence I needed (and helped me practice of course)!</description>
